_Draft in progress._

## Topics to Cover

- Variable audio lengths
- Working with speech data
  - Converting waveforms to spectrograms
  - Standardizing audio lengths
  - Adding controlled noise

## Audio Data Technical Terms

- **Waveform** — time-domain representation showing how amplitude changes over time
- **Amplitude** — strength/intensity of a sound wave; normalized between -1 and 1, measured in dB
